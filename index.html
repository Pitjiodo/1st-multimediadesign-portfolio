               One man. One interest. One passion. That’s pretty much how you would describe me. I’m a young man whose true passion and interest is design. I love design. I love to watch designs and most importantly; I love creating designs. They have their own power, their own way to engender feelings, emotions. It fascinates me that one little line can change the entirety. With these words, welcome to my world. A world of designs. A world of passion.

                    This animation was my very first proper animation. It was made with Adobe Animate, which I was introduced to three days earlier. I used my cartoon avatar to try to make some organic human movements, which was a big challenge. It took me a lot of time, some pictures of walking humans and help from some friends before I got the result I wanted.
                    <br><br>
                    This was only the starting point for some more complex animations in proces. As soon as the animations are done, they will be posted on my YouTube channel where I post animations and videos about drawing and multimedia in general.

                    I got an assignment where I should take a piece of art and make it come to life. This is made with Photoshop and Animate, which was a big, but fun, challenge because I wasn't particulary familiar with these two programs at that moment. Yet I'm happy with the final product.

                    <h1>Horse</h1>
                    <p>
                    One day where I were cleaning my computer I noticed that my background was a really boring, black box with a few white stripes running across it. I thought that I could make something more fun suiting my style, so I went on to google and searched on some different words until I saw a horse. I’m not a horse-person, and I have never ridden on a horse in my life, but I thought it had this special feeling to it, so much power. In that moment I knew I needed to make something from it that could show what I saw. This was the beginning of me making images in this artform that I love.

                    After some time with the horse as a background I wanted a new one, so I went to google once again to find another animal that I could make an image from. When I saw the koala, I thought it was perfect. I love the way this animal doesn’t care about anything and just happily sits on a branch eating leaves. I one again tried to capture what I saw in this animal with colours and lines.

I chose to make this mountain as a cover for my profile because I love standing on the top of mountain after a long walk and just look at the path I took and the world around me.

                    In this project, that was the first big project I made as a multimedia designer student, we were assigned to make suggestions for redesigning my school’s website. It was a very fun assignment that challenged me and made me use all my knowledge in a way I wasn’t used to, even though I was a design student in my previous education.

                    As a small ice breaker project, in the beginning of the first semester, we had to make a stopmotion short movie, in small groups, with a story based on two random words that we got. My group got “brussel sprouts” and “speed dating”. It was challenging getting ideas but after we got the first one others followed. We created the story you can see in the video to the right or by pressing the button below. <br><br>

                    I love music. It contains so many emotions and can change the mood of any situation. That’s why I love using Spotify to listen to music – not only can I hear all the songs that I love but I can also listen to what my friends are listening to and find new songs. I spend a lot of my time making playlists that are harmonic or get me in a special mood. That’s why I also take the extra step and make my covers for them so I myself and others can see what to expect from the playlists.

                    I find that YouTube has become one of the biggest platforms when it comes to social media, communication and influencing in general. Therefore, I’ve also chosen to start creating thumbnails and banners for youtubers since it’s such an important part of marketing yourself and your channel. I was assigned to design the banner on the channel “Caroline Keller”. Furthermore, I also designed some of the thumbnails for the channel’s videos. The challenging part was mainly that the channel is a beauty channel. I’m personally not that familiar with the beauty industry on YouTube and therefore I had to do some research and, in cooperation with the channel, create designs that fitted the industry but at the same time also were different and eye-catching. <br><br>
